          I&apos;m 29 years old, and if there&apos;s one thing I&apos;ve learned
          from my explorative years, it&apos;s that trying out every hobby under
          the sun is a full-time job. Growing up in Las Vegas, NV, I was given a
          glimpse into how live productions were organized and set up. At one
          point, I was even a roadie for live shows. It was one of the hardest
          jobs I ever enjoyed because I got to see each piece of a puzzle come
          together to create a live audio and visual performance.

          In my teens, I stumbled upon some incredible software that opened up a
          world of creativity. I was like a kid in a digital candy store, except
          the candy was music, animation, 3D modeling, and art software. I had
          no idea what I was doing back then, but I wanted to figure it out. I
          made games, created 3D characters, and learned how to record music
          (music recording ended up being my best talent per time spent). This
          set me off to explore creativity, but it also made it hard for me to
          figure out what I wanted to focus on. It definitely didn&apos;t help
          my grades in school. Countless hours working on a computer before I
          even graduated high school was my life. When I wasn&apos;t glued to
          the screen or beating my latest high score in a video game, I was
          outside playing baseball or attempting not to break my neck doing
          extreme sports.

          When college came around, I was eager to dive into software creation,
          blissfully unaware of the joys of maintaining said software. I enjoyed
          the dryness of architectural designs and imagined creating something
          big all by myself. I started with C and C++, eventually moving on to
          higher-level languages. I even had a stint programming in COBOL,
          building tools to extract health data from local hospitals for a
          non-profit. COBOL—because I had older mentors.

          Later, I wanted to get back into a more creative space and mindset. I
          started searching for ways to blend my artistic flair with software
          development. This goal was mine alone, but I knew it was a hard goal
          to reach. The only thing I had control over was my own personal
          projects. Things would stick, but most of the time it was hit or miss.
          Feeling proud of accomplishing anything that showed some dedication is
          my motivation, along with trying to impress my dad, who is experienced
          in both tech and creativity. My mother is where I get my athletic
          spark, and she was a big motivator too.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I&apos;m getting older and more in tune with what I want to pursue,
          it can be daunting. I always had big goals that I couldn&apos;t reach
          within three years because I got so focused on how to get there, not
          realizing the full journey of those goals. I&apos;ve learned,
          especially after reading the wonderful book Atomic Habits by James
          Clear, to embrace the power of small, incremental achievements. These
          stepping stones add up, enhancing my skills and shaping my outlook in
          profound ways.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ultimately, my aim is to merge my creative talents with my technical
          skills, crafting software that doesn&apos;t just solve problems but
          inspires and captivates. It might take some time to get there, but
          I&apos;m enjoying the ride—no matter how long the journey. I remain
          committed to my vision, knowing that with persistence and passion,
          I&apos;ll create something truly remarkable in the world of tech.
